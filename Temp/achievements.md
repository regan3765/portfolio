  I added paginate to the code that i had re-coded as it would get all the scores and i researched laravel pagination to only get the top 10 scores as this is what our client wanted.

## Technical Achievements
------

The scores on the homepage were not showing up properly as they were all over the show for each game so i re-coded What a team mate had done so that it would grab just the top scores for each game and then have to change the view to work with the changes i had made in the controller. [Here](https://github.com/SoftEnOP/op-stats-team-1/commit/5f00fa4c7cd5bc70c2f5e35ba43572da2ccd8745) is the commit.

[Here](https://github.com/SoftEnOP/op-stats-team-1/commit/f50dff5638786a42c3af06b70c7b47f9bd171a99) I merged a branch for fixing the scores to the master branch 

I added a simple feed back that i had implement thought the website so that when you successfully added a score to a game it tells you. [Here](https://github.com/SoftEnOP/op-stats-team-1/commit/3ac06db29c6cc5675290e1b94f352ab992e39775)is the commit.

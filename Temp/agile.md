Our team Followed these Agile principles 

1.  We satisfied the as we gave him valuable software as we delivered the software continuously every 2 weeks
   we done this for the first 2 weeks as we always had bugs after that as we were working on branches we showed the customer what we had working but did not push it to master.

2. As i was working with Ethan and Ryan in the common room or in class i gave them support by telling them what they were missing or how to do something in laravel instead them of looking all through google to find a solution. 
   They were motivated individuals and we gave each other support and trusted them to get the job done and having face-to face conversations being the most efficient and effective method for conveying information.
  

3. Our customer wanted to ban users as we never had a use case for this we had to welcome changing requirement and develop that piece of software. This is Agile.

  
4. We used user stories to help us define what we need to get done and so the customer can understand their problem or what they want and we would give each user story a number from 1 - 10 for the level of difficulty so that no one would be over whelmed with to much work to do.
we used kanban board to track progress, and to see who is working on what user story. 
And we used daily stand up meetings to tell our team about what we had done, what we were going to do and if we encountered  any problems.
Doing this helped us maintain a constant pace, to promote sustainable development indefinitely.

5. At the end of each sprint we would do a retrospective as a team, What worked well, What we need to improve, what were the barriers, and what we need to improve for the next sprint. This is another agile principle.

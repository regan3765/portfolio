I have worked with our project team to keep our services working.

I did work on eliminating the git-lab server unessasary ticketing while I did not fix the issue I think I had stopped that particular check from happening and that seemed to stop the tickets but also mathew did update the amount of ram for that server


Working with Media-analytics site

I added a code and did not no how to restart the website so i restarted the machine. while i thought that would bring this back up it did not. I have been searching the web and through the bash history of the ma server and have found some commands used and found where the nginx is looking for the website

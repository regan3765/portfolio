I think i fixed Ethan's problem but i'm not sure what it was.

Added a drop down menu on the navigation bar and changed the background color of it. The [commit view](https://github.com/SoftEnOP/op-stats-team-1/commit/3780c9d14e05bd36acc2840f8cda96775d83f445).

I made a migration for the games table commit [here](https://github.com/SoftEnOP/op-stats-team-1/commit/e7f39da0027bdb19bafea1f3f871147e5f85b91b). It has a bad commit message

I also made a model for the games, [here](https://github.com/SoftEnOP/op-stats-team-1/commit/195d250bf652eb637e9112be7ff2304463766dfd) is the commit.

I put game view's in its own folder so then i had to change the return view int the controller and moved the games list in the nav bar to were they should be, and i also added the resource in the web routes for the games. Commit [here](https://github.com/SoftEnOP/op-stats-team-1/commit/afe1e9fe621f267d6a1bccff736e506ac8fb6c12).

A merge issue appears to be at the game controller where i added the CRUD for the controller and in the nav bar and in the web routes. [Here](https://github.com/SoftEnOP/op-stats-team-1/commit/361cc7f8a3681d8f06cf3ad71112db2866945f8a).

Another merge conflict in the routes and game controller [here](https://github.com/SoftEnOP/op-stats-team-1/commit/ff33ce831743ea8ba911105b129cb54735bde17e) and [here](https://github.com/SoftEnOP/op-stats-team-1/commit/ad23275236ee8d772efb9d5aa6dab1ba106f79cd).

title: "About the Author  
Hi there! I'm Regan. Iâ€™m a student at Otago Polytechnic in my last year of a Bachelor in IT.

## A bit about myself
I come from a small town called balclutha where im a current member of the local hotrod and classic car club. I like driving the old cars. The picture is a T-bucke that my dad built.
I also play the bagpipes in the balclutha pipeband, and enjoy fishing.
I would also love to travel the world at some point.  "
